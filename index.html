      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.
         Yes, I am!... But the real confirmation comes in knowing chicken nuggets can fly?! Wowza, 2022 is off to an interesting start. :P
      </p>
      <p>Roger that! Incoming chicken nugget targeted. Fire at command.</p>
      <p> Ouch! One just hit me! I knew I should have worn a helmet! I'm dizzy! </p>
      <p>Red Alert!! Pilot in danger! Sending backup with honey mustard sauce grenades and fry sabers. Hold the line til backup arrives.</p>
